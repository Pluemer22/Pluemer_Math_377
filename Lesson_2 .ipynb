Data science uses various tools and methoids to manipulate data to find patterns and make inferences and predictions. I think I will use data science to work on various projects perhaps studying data from different weapon systems to find which is best for different situations.\n",

    "    While  ice cream sales may be associated with violent crime there must be more evidence that leads to actual causality. Every aspect, other that ice cream sales and violence, must be the same to determine if increases in ice cream sales cause an increase in crime. This is very hard to do, which is likely why people can not say with certainty that ice cream sales cause violence.\n",

    "    An observational study simply observes subjects and explores cause and effect relationships. It is more subject to confounding factors. An experient is more controlled and is usually in a lab setting or controlled environment. A good experiemnt uses randomization to mitigate confounding errors. \n",
